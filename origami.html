<p>ORIGAMI CAMEL
    <br>
    There are two types of camels:
    <br>
     One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.
     <br>
Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes
<br>
 to keep sand out of their eyes.
 <br>
Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants
<br>
 other animals can’t eat.
